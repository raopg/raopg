<b>Looking for full-time roles in software development!</b>

## What I'm working on :mechanic:

I am currently volunteering at Helping Hands Community as a software developer. Helping Hands is a volunteer-driven organization in response to the pandemic. Our platform matches volunteers with people who need help. Learn more at <a href="https://helpinghands.community/">Helping Hands</a>

I am looking for full-time opportunities in full-stack web development (I primarily have experience in JS heavy stacks), so if you have any opportunities, feel free to reach out! :smile:

## What I'm currently learning :triumph:
I'm currently learning distributed systems and Go. I hope to build my own distributed database in the near future.

I'm also building out a Gym Log application using React, GraphQL, Node.js and PostgreSQL. You can find the progress <a href=https://github.com/raopg/my-gym-log>here</a>
